    "about-us-paragraph": "Rockland Manor is located in the rapidly growing city of Rockland, ON, approximately 20 minutes east of Ottawa. Our community is surrounded by beautiful landscaping with courtyards full of trees, flowers, and pathways. We are in close proximity to parks, a marina, and other areas with walkways and biking paths. All amenities, including shopping, hair and nail salons, barbers, spas, many restaurants, optometrists, and medical and dental clinics are easily accessible from our location.",
    "about-us-paragraph-2": "Our goal is to make all our residents feel completely at home, which is why we&apos;ve created a warm and inviting atmosphere. Every inch of our community is beautifully and tastefully decorated, reminiscent of a family home instead of feeling cold, uninviting, and institutional. We pride ourselves on being a home and a community, not just another seniors care residence."
